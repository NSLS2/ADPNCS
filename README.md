An [EPICS areaDetector](https://github.com/areaDetector/areaDetector) driver for controlling [PNDetector](https://pndetector.de/) cameras, using their PNCS C++ API. It is being developed for use with the [PNDetector CXC](https://pndetector.de/products-applications/product/the-pncdd-color-x-ray-camera-cxc/) at the SXN beamline.

It has only been tested on Linux, specifically EL10 based distributions (AlmaLinux 10 and RedHat 10).
